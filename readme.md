[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/36c74e3a-8453-4eb4-9b86-dff0fe7fcd6e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cosmicbagel/deploys)

- Github repo for my rarely updated blog
- Auto deploys to netlify static host


#### Notes to future me since you'll forget
- Using hugo 0.53, I guess you can update this if you need to, but eh
  - [Download](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.53)
- Just run `hugo server` while developing
- Using `--minify` in the netlify just cuz, idk if it makes that big of a difference, but why not
- Site still requires JS to display the header icon links, should look into removing that requirement
- You better have studied for that midterm exam, you procrastinating sloth

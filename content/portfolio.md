*In almost all of these projects I operated primarily as a programmer, and secondarily as a game
designer.*

- Pirates - 2020 Winter - A WebGL tech demo I helped work on for CMPT370
    - Usually I don't include school work on here as the projects would be very samey as what anyone
      else who took the class would make, but this particular assignment I'm personally proud of as
      we went a bit further than some of the other teams.
    - It is a "from scratch" renderer that supports a proper 3d camera and texturing
    - Features a debugger and fly cam
    - Primitive but functional gameplay
    - A primitive but functional collision checking system (it would be too much of a stretch to
      call it a "physics" system)

- DecemberBliss - A personal learning project to become more familiar with c/c++
    - This was a project I worked on during the christmas break, and still poke at a bit. The goal
      was to learn more about practical cross-platform c/c++ development by creating a simple 2d
      game with a handful of features I considered to be critical to development. More information
      is included in the project's readme on github.

- Game Dev Club 2019 Winter Semester Project - Big Leaf (Tentative title)
	- It's a gardening simulator of sorts. You play as a mouse character (represented by the durable
    UE4 manakin), and grow plants. I worked on this project in UE4 using blueprints, and developed
    a couple of systems, including a plant "growing" system. The system factored in shade and
    sunlight as it occured within the day/night cycle. Since the world was baked, and not dynamic,
    we were able to place pre-determined shade zones that subtracted away from the natural sun
    light. The sun light would vary according to the day/night cycle. There was also a hydration
    sub-system that took into account watering from a water can and nearby water features that were
    manually placed. Plants would grow/wither/die based on the amount of sun and water given. Too
    much or too little resulted in dead plants over time.
    - The project is very large, so you'll have to contact me if you would like a zip file of it

- This blog
  - Here's the source code for this blog, I'm using Hugo, and a theme I forked, making
    modifications as I go. I try to keep it clean and simple. Hugo generates a static site. I host
    it on netlify that auto deploys and runs hugo when I push updates to github. Netlify hosts the
    static page output, and the result is an efficient, lightweight website. I write everything
    using markdown, hugo takes care of the rest.

- LazyRay - Raytracing / Graphics Study Project
  - Digging into some ray tracing books and learning how ray trace renderers work by writing one.
    On going project, using SDL2 to present rendered image, everything else is software rendering.
  - No ambition to make this into something suitable for the production or development of content,
    it's just a learning project.

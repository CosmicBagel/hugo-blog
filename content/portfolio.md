  - On going project in collaboration with a friend. Inspired by Runescape, a simple MMO-esk game.  Also the only project where I'm working more as a designer than programmer.

- LazyRay - Raytracing / Graphics Study Project
  - Digging into some ray tracing books and learning how ray trace renderers work by writing one. On going project, using SDL2 to present rendered image, everything else is software rendering.
  - No ambition to make this into something suitable for the production or development of content, it's just a learning project.

- This blog
  - Here's the source code for this blog, I'm using Hugo, and a theme I forked, making modifications as I go. I try to keep it clean and simple. Hugo generates a static site. I host it on netlify that auto deploys and runs hugo when I push updates to github. Netlify hosts the static page output, and the result is an efficient, lightweight website. I write everything using markdown, hugo takes care of the rest.

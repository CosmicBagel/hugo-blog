- Added a way to subscribe via email, as I don't really post stuff on social
  media much this should let people get updates. Obviously this only goes out
  when I actually post content, which is rare, so you won't be spamed.
- Started university
- Made some stuff (game jams, projects), will be adding a portfolio page
  soon(TM)
- Started working on a ray tracer and a mini-mmo game inspired by runescape,
  will be updating based on those projects soon
- Might do a rant on some game stuff, who knows

**P.S.**

If you know a better way to distribute blog posts via email then feedburner, I'm
open to recomendations. I don't want to get into constructing a whole newsletter
deal, that's a bit much.
